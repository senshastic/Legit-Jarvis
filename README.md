## Features in Detail

### Automated Reminder System
The bot checks for upcoming events every 5 minutes and sends reminders:
- **30 minutes before** each event
- Mentions player and coach roles
- Shows event details, roster, and event type
- Prevents duplicate reminders

### Daily Noon Reminder
Every day at 12:00 PM, the bot sends:
- A random Marvel Rivals inspirational quote
- Today's complete schedule
- Event types with emojis (🎮 Scrim, 🏆 Official, 🎥 VOD, 🔥 Warmup)
- Full rosters for each event
- Motivational footer message

### Roster Integration
When viewing events, the bot automatically:
- Looks up the roster based on the event title (team name)
- Displays the full roster in the event embed
- Shows player count and all player names
- Works across all calendar commands

### Smart Event Filtering
- `/nextscrim` only shows events from "Scrim" subcalendars
- `/nextofficial` only shows events from "Official" subcalendars
- Filtering is case-insensitive and flexible

## Configuration

### Reminder Times
Edit `config.py` to change reminder intervals:
```python
REMINDER_TIMES = [0.5]  # Hours before event (0.5 = 30 minutes)
```

### Check Interval
Change how often the bot checks for reminders:
```python
CHECK_INTERVAL = 5  # Minutes
```

### Daily Reminder Time
Modify the daily reminder time in `reminders.py`:
```python
@tasks.loop(time=time(hour=12, minute=0))  # 12:00 PM
```
